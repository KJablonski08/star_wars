# Star Wars App

A small application built to interface with [Star Wars](https://swapi.dev) RESTFul API.
Goal: include a list function for returning a list and the ability to drill into a detailed record

Search through category options using a Select Form - Films, Planets, Starships, Vehicles, People, Species
Then filter through search results using the datalist input form 

for fun - use the toggle on the navigation bar to switch from light theme (the force) to dark theme (the dark side)
